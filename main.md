It had been some months since the death of Socrates, when his disciple Phaedo sat with friends in the town of Phlius and recounted those final hours. The memory of that day was still vivid, etched in his heart, and the telling mattered—not just for the great words spoken, but for the smallest details. These were not curiosities but treasures for those who loved him, fragments of a life they longed to hold onto.

The end had been delayed for thirty days, as the sacred ship traveled to Delos and back, a religious observance that postponed all executions. Those days became a strange gift: a month of conversation, laughter, and shared quiet with the teacher they knew they would soon lose. Now the holy season was finished, and the disciples gathered early that morning, longing for every last word they could draw from him.

Many were there: Simmias and Cebes from Thebes, drawn to Socrates as if by enchantment; Crito, the faithful elder friend; Hermogenes, Apollodorus with his restless spirit, Euclid and Terpsion from Megara, Ctesippus, Antisthenes, Menexenus, and others who simply listened in reverent silence. Some, like Plato himself, were not present. And in a tender moment, Socrates sent his wife Xanthippe and their children home, not wanting their grief to hang heavy in the air.

Freed at last from his chains, Socrates stretched his limbs and mused that pain and pleasure are always woven together, each following the other like companions. “Aesop,” he smiled, “would have told a fable of them as a two-headed creature of the gods.” This light remark stirred a question from Cebes: why, in his final days, had Socrates turned to writing verses of Aesop’s fables? The old philosopher explained that throughout his life, dreams had whispered to him, urging him to “practice music.” He had always assumed this meant philosophy, the harmony of the soul. But as his death drew near, he wanted to honor the message in every sense, and so he set Aesop’s tales into verse—words made into music.

He asked that Evenus, a poet, be told of this, and that he should follow him soon into death. “But he is not the sort to hasten his end,” came the reply. Socrates answered gently: “If he is a true philosopher, he will not fear death. Though he will not take his own life—that is unlawful—he will know that to die is not something to resist.”

Cebes then asked a hard question: *if death is such a good, why is it considered wrong to take one’s own life?*

Socrates offered two ways of thinking. First, life is like a prison, and we are not free to open the door and run away on our own. That’s part of a divine mystery. Second, and perhaps more importantly, we are not our own possession—we belong to the gods. And so it is not ours to throw away what has been entrusted to us.

But Cebes pressed further: *If we belong to the gods, why would we want to leave them? Are they not the best guardians? Surely they care for us better than we could care for ourselves.*

Simmias gently clarified what Cebes really meant. He was not speaking in general, but of Socrates himself. His friends found it strange that Socrates seemed so untroubled at leaving the gods, and leaving them.

Socrates replied with quiet confidence: “I am not leaving the gods. I am going to them—perhaps to wiser and better ones—and maybe even to truer friends. If you think I am too calm, let me defend myself before you now, as my judges. I only hope to succeed better with you than I did with the court.”

Then he spoke of what death truly is. Death, he said, is the separation of soul from body. And this is exactly what the true philosopher longs for. Not because he is guilty and deserves punishment, as the world might think, but because he yearns to be free from the endless distractions of the body—the cravings, the pleasures, the clamor of the senses that cloud the mind’s vision.

“What I want,” he said, “is to behold truth with the mind alone, without eyes that mislead or ears that confuse. All the troubles and impurities of life come through the body. Death frees the soul from these burdens, which we can never fully escape while alive. Why should I grieve when that hour comes? For in a way, I have already died to these things while living. And only through this final death can wisdom be seen in her purest light.”
