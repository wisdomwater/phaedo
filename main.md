It had been some months since the death of Socrates, when his disciple Phaedo sat with friends in the town of Phlius and recounted those final hours. The memory of that day was still vivid, etched in his heart, and the telling mattered—not just for the great words spoken, but for the smallest details. These were not curiosities but treasures for those who loved him, fragments of a life they longed to hold onto.

The end had been delayed for thirty days, as the sacred ship traveled to Delos and back, a religious observance that postponed all executions. Those days became a strange gift: a month of conversation, laughter, and shared quiet with the teacher they knew they would soon lose. Now the holy season was finished, and the disciples gathered early that morning, longing for every last word they could draw from him.

Many were there: Simmias and Cebes from Thebes, drawn to Socrates as if by enchantment; Crito, the faithful elder friend; Hermogenes, Apollodorus with his restless spirit, Euclid and Terpsion from Megara, Ctesippus, Antisthenes, Menexenus, and others who simply listened in reverent silence. Some, like Plato himself, were not present. And in a tender moment, Socrates sent his wife Xanthippe and their children home, not wanting their grief to hang heavy in the air.

Freed at last from his chains, Socrates stretched his limbs and mused that pain and pleasure are always woven together, each following the other like companions. “Aesop,” he smiled, “would have told a fable of them as a two-headed creature of the gods.” This light remark stirred a question from Cebes: why, in his final days, had Socrates turned to writing verses of Aesop’s fables? The old philosopher explained that throughout his life, dreams had whispered to him, urging him to “practice music.” He had always assumed this meant philosophy, the harmony of the soul. But as his death drew near, he wanted to honor the message in every sense, and so he set Aesop’s tales into verse—words made into music.

He asked that Evenus, a poet, be told of this, and that he should follow him soon into death. “But he is not the sort to hasten his end,” came the reply. Socrates answered gently: “If he is a true philosopher, he will not fear death. Though he will not take his own life—that is unlawful—he will know that to die is not something to resist.”

Cebes then asked a hard question: *if death is such a good, why is it considered wrong to take one’s own life?*

Socrates offered two ways of thinking. First, life is like a prison, and we are not free to open the door and run away on our own. That’s part of a divine mystery. Second, and perhaps more importantly, we are not our own possession—we belong to the gods. And so it is not ours to throw away what has been entrusted to us.

But Cebes pressed further: *If we belong to the gods, why would we want to leave them? Are they not the best guardians? Surely they care for us better than we could care for ourselves.*

Simmias gently clarified what Cebes really meant. He was not speaking in general, but of Socrates himself. His friends found it strange that Socrates seemed so untroubled at leaving the gods, and leaving them.

Socrates replied with quiet confidence: “I am not leaving the gods. I am going to them—perhaps to wiser and better ones—and maybe even to truer friends. If you think I am too calm, let me defend myself before you now, as my judges. I only hope to succeed better with you than I did with the court.”

Then he spoke of what death truly is. Death, he said, is the separation of soul from body. And this is exactly what the true philosopher longs for. Not because he is guilty and deserves punishment, as the world might think, but because he yearns to be free from the endless distractions of the body—the cravings, the pleasures, the clamor of the senses that cloud the mind’s vision.

“What I want,” he said, “is to behold truth with the mind alone, without eyes that mislead or ears that confuse. All the troubles and impurities of life come through the body. Death frees the soul from these burdens, which we can never fully escape while alive. Why should I grieve when that hour comes? For in a way, I have already died to these things while living. And only through this final death can wisdom be seen in her purest light.”

Socrates went on to explain that the philosopher sees good and evil differently from most people. Ordinary courage, he said, often comes from fear of greater dangers. And what people call temperance usually comes from the desire for greater pleasures. This is not true virtue, but only a trade—a balancing of pains and pleasures.

For the philosopher, the virtues are not bargains. They are purifications of the soul. Wisdom, courage, temperance—these are ways of cleansing the inner life so it can draw nearer to truth. Socrates remembered the words of the ancient mystery religions: *many carry the wand, but few are truly initiated.* In other words, many walk the outward path, but only a few grasp the heart of it. “I hope,” he said, “that I am counted among the few, and so I depart with peace. This is why I do not tremble at leaving the gods and my friends.”

Still, his companions voiced a fear: what if the soul simply dissolves when it leaves the body—like smoke fading into air?

Socrates turned first to tradition, recalling the old Orphic teaching that souls of the dead dwell in the underworld, and from them the living are born again. Then he framed it philosophically: all opposites arise from one another—greater from lesser, stronger from weaker, waking from sleeping, life from death. If life only flowed into death, and nothing ever rose again, the world would simply end in silence. Sleep itself would lose meaning, for all would collapse into an endless slumber. The circle of nature is whole only if the living also come from the dead, just as surely as they pass to them.

Socrates then brought forward another teaching—the doctrine of recollection, or reminiscence. This, he said, confirms the soul’s existence before birth. He explained: when someone untrained in mathematics is shown a simple diagram, they can often work out truths they never learned before. It is as if the knowledge was sleeping within them, waiting to be awakened.

We see the same thing in everyday associations. Seeing Simmias may make you think of Cebes, or seeing a picture of Simmias may remind you of the man himself. A lyre may bring to mind its player. And when we look at two sticks or stones of equal length, they can call to mind something beyond them—the idea of equality itself. Yet notice that these material examples never perfectly capture equality. They always fall short. So where does our measure of true equality come from, if not from the senses?

It must exist prior to all these imperfect examples. And if it is prior to what we see and touch, then it must have been given to us before we were born. For we recognize it, but only by recalling it. That means our souls must have existed, and must have known, in some former state. In other words, if the doctrine of Ideas is true, then so is the pre-existence of the soul.

At this point, Simmias and Cebes raised an objection. Even if souls existed before birth, this does not prove they will continue after death. What if the soul ends when the body ends?

Socrates responded by returning to the earlier argument—that the living arise from the dead, completing the circle. But still, he admitted, the fear remains: what if the soul simply dissolves into air when it leaves the body, especially with a strong wind?

“Then let us ask,” he said, “what kind of things dissolve? Is it what is simple or what is made of parts? What is unchanging, or what is changing? What is invisible, or what is seen by the senses? Clearly it is the compound, the changing, the visible that decays—not the simple and unchanging.”

The soul, in its pure thought, belongs to the simple and unchanging. Only when it uses the senses does it become entangled in the world of change. Moreover, the soul commands while the body serves—showing its kinship with the divine, while the body belongs to the mortal. In every way, the soul reflects immortality, while the body reflects decay.

Even the body, however, can be preserved for ages by the art of embalming. How much more, then, should we trust that the soul will not scatter into nothingness as it journeys to the God who is wise and good! For the true philosopher has already gathered the soul inward, turning it away from the body, practicing the art of dying long before death comes. And now, finally released from human passions and errors, the soul may dwell forever in the company of the gods.

But not every soul, Socrates said, is ready for such release. The soul that has been weighed down by the body—addicted to its appetites, trusting only in what the senses show—cannot rise into clarity. Such a soul clings to the familiar. Fearing the unknown, it hovers near the grave, unwilling to leave the body it once adored. These souls appear as ghostly figures, heavy with the imprint of the senses.

In time, they are drawn back into forms that match the life they lived. A life of violence or indulgence may lead to rebirth as a wolf, an ass, or a bird of prey. Souls who lived decent lives, practicing some measure of virtue though without philosophy, may take gentler shapes—bees, ants, or other social creatures. But only the soul of the philosopher, purified and free, is welcomed among the gods.

This, Socrates explained, is why the true philosopher avoids bodily excess—not out of fear of shame or loss, as others do, but because he knows that pleasures and pains are chains fastening the soul to the body. Philosophy has whispered to him, and he has listened. She has called him out of the mire, washed away the haze of passion and illusion, and set him free. Such a soul, once released, will not return to bondage, but will rest in freedom and truth.

Still, Simmias and Cebes could not help their doubts. Out of respect for the moment, they hesitated to raise them. Socrates noticed their silence and urged them to speak. “Do not hold back,” he said. “Think of me as a swan. All my life I have sung to Apollo, and now, at my death, I sing louder and clearer than ever before.”

Simmias admitted that it was cowardly not to search for truth. “If divine certainty cannot be found,” he said, “then at least let us cling to the best human reasoning we can, and let it be the little boat that carries us across the sea of life.” Then he voiced his concern. Socrates had argued that the soul is invisible and without body, and therefore immortal. But could it not be like the harmony of a lyre? Harmony, too, is unseen and without body, yet when the lyre is broken, the harmony perishes with it. Might not the soul vanish the same way when the body dies?

Cebes had his own concern. He agreed that the soul may outlast the body, and even wear out many bodies over time. But endurance does not guarantee eternity. Perhaps the soul, after passing through many births and deaths, finally wears out itself, like a weaver who has woven and worn out many coats, until at last he dies and leaves one coat behind. In the same way, the body might outlive the soul. If the soul is truly immortal, it must not only outlast one or many bodies—it must outlast them all, never failing.

At this point the mood of the room shifted, like the chorus in a play reflecting the emotions of the actors. A heaviness settled over the friends. There was a pause, a kind of sorrowful silence, before the inquiry began again.

It was a sobering thought: arguments, like men, can be deceivers. And those who have been deceived many times often become distrustful, not only of arguments, but of people as well. Yet Socrates urged that this must not lead us into bitterness—neither misanthropy nor mistrust of reason. If arguments fail, the fault lies not in reason itself, but in our own weakness in grasping it.

Socrates admitted his own difficulty. On the very edge of death, he knew how much he wanted the arguments for the soul’s immortality to be true. “I long for them to be so,” he confessed, “and therefore I may not see clearly. So I beg you: if you find error in what I say, test it, refute it. Let us seek the truth together.”

At his invitation, Simmias and Cebes repeated their objections. Simmias still held that the soul might be a kind of harmony arising from the body. But this, Socrates replied, does not sit well with the very idea of pre-existence. A harmony is the result of its parts, an effect rather than a cause. The soul, however, is a leader, not a follower. A harmony comes in degrees—more or less tuned—yet the soul admits of no such degrees.

Moreover, Socrates asked, if the soul were simply a harmony, how could one soul be better than another? Could one harmony contain another harmony? That is absurd. And what of the times when the soul resists the body—when reason pushes back against desire, as Homer writes of Odysseus rebuking his own heart? Would such resistance be possible if the soul were nothing more than the harmony of the body? Clearly not. To claim so is to contradict both Homer and ourselves.

Socrates, with a playful smile, said they had dealt well with the goddess Harmonia—that is, the argument of Simmias. Now it was time to face the objection of Cebes, the Theban. He restated Cebes’ concern, which touched on the deepest question of all: the nature of growth and causation. To answer, Socrates began to share his own journey of thought.

“When I was young,” he confessed, “I was fascinated by natural science. I studied how animals grow and decay, how thought might arise, and many other such questions. But in time I became tangled in contradictions. I even began to doubt obvious truths, such as whether growth really comes from food and drink. Eventually I realized that such inquiries were not for me.”

He explained that he had also puzzled over mathematics—about greater and lesser, about how numbers combine and divide. “I thought I understood them,” he said, “but the more I questioned, the more contradictions I found. How can one truly become two, or two become one? I could make no sense of it.”

At last he turned away from trying to explain generation and destruction by material means. “I came to feel,” he said, “that another way was needed.”

Then he encountered a book by the philosopher Anaxagoras, who taught that *Mind* is the cause of all things. Socrates was thrilled. “If this is true,” he thought, “then everything must be arranged for the best. Here is the teacher who will reveal to me the order and goodness at the heart of life and nature.”

But his joy quickly turned to disappointment. For Anaxagoras, though he named Mind as the cause, soon fell back into speaking of winds and waters and other mechanical explanations. He failed to show how Mind orders all things for the good.

Socrates offered an example: “If someone asks why I am sitting here, would you say it is because of my bones and muscles? That is true in one sense. But the real reason is different: the Athenians judged it good to sentence me to death, and I judged it good to remain and accept their sentence. If my bones and muscles had acted on their own, they would have carried me away long ago. To explain my presence only by bones and muscles is to confuse the condition with the cause.”

This same confusion, Socrates noted, led people astray in their theories about the earth’s motions and position. They mistook material conditions for true causes. “None of them see,” he said, “that the power of the good is stronger than any Atlas. Yet this ‘best’—the true reason why things are as they are—remains undiscovered. At best, we can only reach what is second-best.”

Socrates then spoke of a danger in contemplating the nature of things. It is like gazing at the sun during an eclipse—one must be careful not to damage the eyes. Instead, we look at the sun’s reflection in water or in glass. “In the same way,” he said, “I feared for the eye of my soul. I thought it safer to turn to the clear path of Ideas. Not that one who contemplates existence through the Ideas sees only dimly—no more than one who looks at the reflection of the sun sees dimly—but rather that this is the safer way for me.”

If the existence of the Ideas is granted, Socrates believed, then the immortality of the soul could be shown without difficulty. He asked only one more thing: that we admit Beauty itself is the cause of all that is beautiful, Greatness the cause of all that is great, Smallness the cause of all that is small, and so on with the rest.

“This,” he said, “is the safe and simple answer. It spares us the contradictions of saying that something is greater because of something smaller, or that addition and subtraction explain the very essence of things. Let subtler minds chase those puzzles. As for me, I prefer to test an idea by its consequences. And if pressed to give an account of it, I return to some higher principle that seems best, until at last I reach a place where I can rest.”

The company agreed readily with the doctrine of Ideas, a truth they had long accepted and which, as the Phliasian listener remarked, would surely command the assent of any thoughtful person. Socrates then pressed further, wanting to explain how opposites might appear to exist together, but in truth they never do.

Take Simmias as an example, he said. Compared with Socrates, Simmias is tall. Compared with Phaedo, he is short. We might say he is both tall and short. But in reality, he is not both at once. He is tall in relation to one man and short in relation to another. The qualities themselves—tallness and shortness—never occupy the same place at the same time. If smallness is in me, then greatness is driven out.

One of the friends objected: *But did you not once argue that opposites generate one another?*

Yes, Socrates replied, but that argument concerned the process of becoming, not the Ideas themselves. Living things give rise to dying, and dying gives rise to living. But life and death as Ideas, or greatness and smallness in themselves, never coexist in the same subject.

He went on: this principle of exclusion holds not only for opposites themselves, but also for whatever is inseparably bound to them. Heat is opposed to cold, and fire, which is inseparably linked with heat, can never admit cold. Snow, bound up with cold, can never admit heat. In the same way, odd and even exclude one another, and the number three, which always carries oddness, can never admit evenness.

So we can go a step further. Just as three, which participates in oddness, will always resist evenness, so the soul, which always carries life, will always resist death. Life excludes death, and since the soul is inseparably bound to life, it too excludes death. What is inseparable from life cannot perish.

If the principle of oddness itself were imperishable, then three would never be destroyed when confronted with evenness—it would simply withdraw. So too, the soul, bound to life, does not perish when death approaches. It withdraws, but it does not cease. The immortal is imperishable. And therefore, the soul cannot die.

With these arguments, the circle of objections was closed. The company fell quiet, as if recognizing that the soul’s immortality had been firmly established. And now Socrates turned to what mattered most: the application.

“If the soul is indeed immortal,” he asked, “what kind of people ought we to be? Not only with regard to our brief span of time here, but with regard to eternity. For death is not the end. The wicked are not freed from their evil by dying; each person carries into the next world only what they have become.”

He explained that after death the soul is carried to judgment. There, she receives what is fitting, and in the cycle of ages may return to earth again. The wise and purified soul knows her path. She follows the angel who guides her surely through the twisting ways of the world below. But the soul that is impure and unprepared drifts without direction—restless, unaccompanied, wandering until at last she is drawn to her own place, just as the purified soul is carried to hers.

“To help you understand this more clearly,” Socrates said, “I must describe to you the true nature and form of the earth.”

Socrates began to describe the earth as it truly is.

“The whole earth,” he said, “is a perfect globe, resting in the center of the heavens, held there by the balance of all things. What we call ‘the earth’—the land we walk upon—is but a shallow hollow, where mists and waters and the thick lower air have settled. The true earth lies above, in a finer and purer element.

“If we, like birds, could rise through the air as fish rise through the sea, we would behold the real earth and the real heavens and stars. What we see here is dulled and corrupted. Even the fairest land of our world is nothing but mud and water compared with that higher realm. But the heavenly earth shines with many colors, bright with jewels more brilliant than gold and purer than snow, blooming with endless flowers and fruit. Its people dwell along the sea of air or in the ‘islands of the blessed,’ speaking with the gods and beholding the sun, moon, and stars as they truly are. Their blessedness matches this beauty.”

He went on to describe the hidden depths beneath our own world. The surface of the globe, he said, is full of hollows of many shapes and sizes, all connected by underground channels. At the center is a vast chasm called Tartarus, where streams of fire, water, and liquid mud flow continually. From there, smaller branches rise to the surface, giving birth to our seas, rivers, and volcanoes.

The whole earth breathes in and out: waters fall into the depths, return again, and in their course form rivers and lakes. Yet none pass beyond the very center; on either side sheer precipices halt their flow.

Among these rivers, four are greatest. Oceanus flows all around the earth like a girdle. Acheron runs the opposite way, winding under the earth through desert places until it reaches the Acherusian Lake, where the souls of the dead wait for their time to return to life. Pyriphlegethon, a stream of fire, coils around the earth before plunging into Tartarus. The fourth, Cocytus, is the river sung of by poets as the Stygian stream; it forms the dark lake of Styx and gathers strange powers from its waters before descending too into Tartarus.”

Socrates then described what becomes of the dead. First, every soul is judged according to its deeds. Those who are beyond cure, hardened in wickedness, are cast into Tartarus and never return. Those guilty of lesser faults undergo purification for their wrongs and then receive reward for the good they have done.

There are others, guilty of grave but not unforgivable crimes. These, too, are thrown into Tartarus. But after a year, the currents of Pyriphlegethon or Cocytus cast them forth, carrying them to the Acherusian Lake. There they call upon the souls they have wronged, begging release. If their victims consent, they may at last step out into the lake and find rest from their suffering. If not, they are swept back into Tartarus, to circle again and again, until mercy is finally granted.

Meanwhile, the pure souls receive their reward. They dwell in the upper earth, in places of brightness and peace. And a select few, the noblest and most purified, ascend to mansions fairer still.

Socrates admitted that he could not insist on the literal truth of every detail in this description. But he was certain of this much: something like it awaits us. And so, he said, the one who has sought the joy of wisdom and turned away from the cravings of the body has every reason to meet death with hope. For already death’s voice is whispering, and one day it will call to all.

At last the hour had come, and Socrates was asked how he wished to be buried. He gently refused the question. “You will not be burying me,” he said, “but only this body. When the time comes, you may lay it in the earth, but do not think of it as me. For I will be gone.”

He added with a touch of humor: “Once you gave surety that I would remain here. Now you shall give surety that I have escaped.” Still, he did not despise the customs of burial—washing, rites, and ceremony would be done as was fitting.

When the cup of poison was brought, Socrates asked whether he might pour out a portion as a libation. The jailer said no, only enough was prepared for drinking. “Very well,” Socrates replied, “then I will make the offering in spirit, if not in form.”

And as he drank, he made one last request—words that puzzled many after him: “Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. See that it is paid.” Some thought he spoke with irony, lightly remembering a small religious duty in his final moment, just as earlier he had written verses to honor a dream’s command. Others believed he meant something deeper: that in death he had been restored to true health, and so he offered a thank-offering to the god of healing.
