A Timeless Dialogue, Retold for the Modern Soul

Plato’s Phaedo has long stood as one of the world’s great meditations on life, death, and the immortality of the soul. In this warm and accessible retelling, the final hours of Socrates unfold not as distant philosophy, but as a living conversation — tender, searching, and deeply human.

Each chapter offers:
* a modern retelling of the story,
* a gentle reflection to draw out its meaning,
* questions for contemplation,
* and a short blessing to nourish the heart.

Created as a companion for quiet mornings, evening reflection, or slow spiritual reading, this devotional-style edition invites you to walk with Socrates through his final day — to consider what it means to live wisely, love deeply, and meet death with peace.

A book for seekers, students, and all who long to live with clarity and courage, *Phaedo: A Reflection on Life and Death* bridges ancient wisdom and the modern spiritual journey with compassion and light.
