a farewell, a remembering, a guide for how to live.

This modern retelling brings new light to Plato’s Phaedo, blending timeless wisdom with gentle reflection. Each chapter invites you to slow down, to listen deeply, and to discover what endures when all else falls away.

A meditation for those who seek clarity, peace,
and the courage to live — and die — awake.
