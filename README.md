# Phaedo: A Devotional Retelling

### Living and Dying Well

This project is a contemplative retelling of Plato’s *Phaedo* — the dialogue that records Socrates’ final conversation before his death. It seeks to bring the timeless wisdom of the soul’s immortality into warm, accessible language for the modern reader.

## Purpose

The *Phaedo* is both philosophical and deeply human — a meditation on truth, courage, and the mystery of death. This project offers:

* **Modern Language**: Clear, inviting prose that preserves the essence of Socrates’ final teachings without academic density.
* **Devotional Tone**: A reflective rhythm that draws the reader inward, turning philosophy into lived contemplation.
* **Transformative Reading**: Designed not only to be understood, but to be *felt* — as a guide for living with clarity and dying with peace.

This is not a scholarly commentary but a devotional rendering — a spiritual companion for the journey of the soul.

## Who This Is For

* Readers who wish to encounter Socrates as a teacher of the spirit, not just the mind.
* Seekers exploring the nature of the soul, mortality, and wisdom.
* Anyone longing for a calm, thoughtful guide to living and dying well.

## Format

This retelling is inspired by the [public domain Jowett translation](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658) and reinterpreted with:

* Modern, meditative prose that flows with warmth and ease.
* Reflective questions and blessings to carry into daily life.
* A closing benediction to leave the reader at peace.

Would you like me to make a **slightly shorter variant** (optimized for GitHub’s repository preview pane, ~⅔ this length) or keep this full devotional tone as your main README?
