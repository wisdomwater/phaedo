# Chapter 15: The Last Words of Socrates

At last the time came. The jailer entered, carrying the cup of hemlock. He handed it to Socrates, who received it calmly, without trembling. His friends wept openly, but Socrates rebuked their grief gently. *“Be quiet, and show courage,”* he said. *“I have heard that one should die in silence.”*

He prayed inwardly, then lifted the cup and drank. No ceremony, no fear — only peace.

Soon the poison began to work. Socrates walked about until his legs grew heavy, then lay down as instructed. The chill rose slowly through his body. His friends stood around him, unable to speak, overcome with sorrow.

Just before the end, Socrates spoke one last request: *“Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Pay the debt, and do not neglect it.”* These were his final words.

With that, he grew still. His eyes fixed, his chest no longer rose. Phaedo ended his tale with quiet reverence: *“Such was the end of our friend, a man who, of all the men of that time whom we have known, was the best, and also the wisest and most just.”*

### Reflection

There is mystery in Socrates’ final words: *“We owe a cock to Asclepius.”* Asclepius was the god of healing, and a cock was offered in thanks for recovery. Was Socrates saying that death itself was a kind of healing, the soul finally cured of the body’s afflictions? Or was he simply honoring a forgotten duty, showing that nothing should be left undone?

Either way, his final act was consistent with his life: attentive, faithful, at peace. He met death as he had lived — with serenity, clarity, and completeness.

For us, the lesson is not to imitate every detail, but to see what shines through: that death need not be feared. That life, if lived attentively, prepares us for dying. That every act, even the smallest offering, matters. And that wisdom is not only in words but in the way one departs.

* How do I think of death: as an ending, a healing, or something else?
* What “debts” or unfinished tasks remain in my life, and how might I complete them?
* How can I live so that when my own end comes, it is marked not by fear, but by peace?

*Death is not the enemy but the final healing. May I live attentively, so that when the last cup comes, I may drink with peace and leave nothing undone.*
