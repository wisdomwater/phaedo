# Chapter 8: The Soul’s Kinship with the Divine

Even with the arguments of opposites and recollection, some still wondered whether the soul might dissolve like smoke at the moment of death.

Socrates answered by asking: what kind of things dissolve? That which is composite, changeable, visible. Bodies rot and scatter, for they are made of parts. But what is simple, invisible, and unchanging does not scatter.

The soul, when it turns inward, belongs to this higher order. It is not seen by the eyes or touched by the hands. It does not bend or break like bone, nor fade like flesh. In her purest thought, the soul is steady, aligned with truth, akin to what is divine. The body serves, but the soul commands. The body belongs to mortality; the soul bears the mark of immortality.

Even the body can last a surprising length of time if preserved with skill. How much more, then, the soul — gathered into herself, practiced in detachment, devoted to wisdom. Such a soul does not scatter like smoke but journeys onward, returning to her true home among the eternal.
