# Chapter 1: The Last Day

It had been months since Socrates died, yet for Phaedo the memory was vivid, as though he were still there in the prison. When he told the story to his friends in Phlius, they wanted to know everything — the words, the gestures, even the smallest details. For when a great soul departs, nothing is too small to remember.

Socrates’ execution had been delayed for thirty days, while Athens waited for the sacred ship to return from Delos. During that month he lived as he always had: in conversation, gentle and probing, never bitter, never afraid. But now the festival was complete, and his death could no longer be delayed. His companions came early, eager for every remaining moment.

They found him just released from his chains. Stretching his legs, he smiled and remarked that pain and pleasure are never far apart — always chasing each other like bound companions. Even in this moment, Socrates could glimpse truth in the simplest things.

When asked why he had been composing verses from Aesop’s fables, Socrates explained that all his life dreams had whispered to him, *“Practice music.”* He had always taken this to mean philosophy, the music of the soul seeking harmony with truth. But now, near the end, he wished to honor the command literally as well, setting simple fables into verse. Nothing was too small to complete.

Thus the last day began, not with despair or panic, but with peace.
