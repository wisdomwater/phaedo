### Reflection

This myth is not meant as a map of the afterlife, but as a mirror for the soul. The true earth above reminds us that our world, however beautiful, is only a dim reflection of a greater reality. The rivers beneath remind us of the currents that carry us — fire, lament, cleansing, renewal. Each soul is drawn to its own place, carried by what it has become.

What matters is not whether we imagine Tartarus or Styx literally, but whether we live awake to the truth they symbolize: that life is part of a larger whole, and our choices shape the journey of the soul. There are higher worlds of beauty and lower depths of corruption, and the soul gravitates toward what it has practiced.

This vision is less about fear and more about alignment. We are invited to live in such a way that our souls are drawn upward, toward light, toward beauty, toward the company of the eternal.
