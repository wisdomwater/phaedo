# Chapter 8: The Soul’s Kinship with the Divine

Even with the arguments of opposites and recollection, some still wondered whether the soul might dissolve like smoke at the moment of death.

Socrates answered by asking: what kind of things dissolve? That which is composite, changeable, visible. Bodies rot and scatter, for they are made of parts. But what is simple, invisible, and unchanging does not scatter.

The soul, when it turns inward, belongs to this higher order. It is not seen by the eyes or touched by the hands. It does not bend or break like bone, nor fade like flesh. In her purest thought, the soul is steady, aligned with truth, akin to what is divine. The body serves, but the soul commands. The body belongs to mortality; the soul bears the mark of immortality.

Even the body can last a surprising length of time if preserved with skill. How much more, then, the soul — gathered into herself, practiced in detachment, devoted to wisdom. Such a soul does not scatter like smoke but journeys onward, returning to her true home among the eternal.

This is one of the most hopeful turns in the dialogue. Socrates reminds us that we mistake the body for the self. Yet the body is only the outer garment, changing daily, destined to fade. The soul is of another kind — invisible, commanding, capable of touching what is eternal.

When we glimpse beauty, when we feel conscience stir, when we taste joy that no possession can give — these are moments when the soul remembers her kinship with the divine. They remind us that we are not creatures of clay alone, but also of light.

To live with this awareness is to loosen fear of death. For if the soul is of the same nature as what is immortal, then death is not the soul’s end but her return.

* Where do I notice the contrast between what is mortal in me and what feels immortal?
* When have I glimpsed my own soul’s kinship with what is eternal?
* How might I live more from that center, letting the soul guide and the body serve?

---

*The soul is born of the eternal. May I live from that kinship, and return without fear when the time comes.*
