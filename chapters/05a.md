# Chapter 5: True Virtue as Purification

Socrates went on to speak about virtue, for even here misunderstandings abound.

Most people, he said, think themselves virtuous when they restrain desire out of fear or balance one pleasure against another. The brave soldier stands firm in battle not because he loves truth, but because he fears shame or punishment more than death. The temperate man avoids excess not because he seeks wisdom, but because he desires health or reputation more than indulgence. In this way, so much of what passes for virtue is really a trade — exchanging one pleasure for another, one fear for another.

The philosopher seeks something different. True virtue is not bargaining but purification. It is the slow cleansing of the soul from the fog of bodily desires, from the endless tug of pleasure and pain. It is the turning of the inner eye toward what is eternal, so that the soul becomes clear enough to receive truth.

The mysteries of religion had hinted at this long ago: *Many carry the wand, but few are true initiates.* Many wear the outward signs of wisdom, but only a few are genuinely transformed. And it is in the hope of being among those few that Socrates now prepares to depart.
