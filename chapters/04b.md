### Reflection

The body is not evil, but it is noisy. It fills our days with needs, demands, and hungers. Much of life is lived in response to these voices, and too often we mistake them for the whole of reality. Yet beneath the clamor, there is a quieter voice — the voice of the soul, longing for what is eternal.

The practice of philosophy, in Socrates’ vision, is learning to listen to that deeper voice. To practice death is not to despise life, but to disentangle ourselves from its distractions so that truth can be seen more clearly.

We might not be philosophers in the ancient sense, but the invitation is the same: to live with spaciousness, to notice the clamors of the body without being ruled by them, and to taste even now the freedom that death will one day bring in full.
