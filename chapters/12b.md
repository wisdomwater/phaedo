### Reflection

Here Socrates moves from theory to practice: if the soul is immortal, then every choice matters. We do not cast off our character at death like a worn garment. We carry into eternity the self we have become.

This is both sobering and hopeful. Sobering, because we cannot hide from what we are — the soul remembers. Hopeful, because purification is always possible. Each act of letting go, each step toward wisdom, each practice of truth makes the soul lighter, more ready for the journey.

Life, then, is rehearsal for eternity. Not in fear, but in freedom. We are shaping, even now, the soul we will carry beyond this life.
