# Chapter 15: The Last Words of Socrates

At last the time came. The jailer entered, carrying the cup of hemlock. He handed it to Socrates, who received it calmly, without trembling. His friends wept openly, but Socrates rebuked their grief gently. *“Be quiet, and show courage,”* he said. *“I have heard that one should die in silence.”*

He prayed inwardly, then lifted the cup and drank. No ceremony, no fear — only peace.

Soon the poison began to work. Socrates walked about until his legs grew heavy, then lay down as instructed. The chill rose slowly through his body. His friends stood around him, unable to speak, overcome with sorrow.

Just before the end, Socrates spoke one last request: *“Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Pay the debt, and do not neglect it.”* These were his final words.

With that, he grew still. His eyes fixed, his chest no longer rose. Phaedo ended his tale with quiet reverence: *“Such was the end of our friend, a man who, of all the men of that time whom we have known, was the best, and also the wisest and most just.”*
