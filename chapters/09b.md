### Reflection

This teaching can sound strange to modern ears, with its talk of reincarnation and ghostly souls. But the image carries a truth we know: desire can bind us. What we cling to shapes us, and what shapes us follows us beyond this moment.

If we live consumed by cravings — for comfort, for power, for recognition — those cravings do not simply vanish when circumstances change. They remain with us, heavy on the soul. In this sense, we create our own chains.

The philosopher’s way is not about despising the body, but about refusing to be ruled by it. To live in purity is to loosen the knots of craving so that when the time comes, the soul can rise lightly, unburdened, free.
