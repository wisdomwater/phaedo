### Reflection

This scene reveals something just as important as the arguments themselves: the spirit in which they are tested. Socrates’ friends fear to raise their doubts because he is about to die. Yet he insists: truth matters more than his pride, more even than his comfort in his last hours.

How easy it is to avoid hard questions — in philosophy, in faith, in life. We fear what doubt may unravel, so we leave it unspoken. But unspoken doubts only grow heavier. Socrates shows another way: to bring questions into the open, to welcome them with gentleness, and to keep searching.

This is the mark of a soul truly free: not afraid of scrutiny, not shaken by doubt, but patient, steady, and willing to learn even in the face of death.
