### Questions

* Where do I notice the contrast between what is mortal in me and what feels immortal?
* When have I glimpsed my own soul’s kinship with what is eternal?
* How might I live more from that center, letting the soul guide and the body serve?

---

*The soul is born of the eternal. May I live from that kinship, and return without fear when the time comes.*
