### Reflection

There is something tender in this image: the philosopher, chained in prison, composing verses like a child learning music. The great mind, preparing to meet death, turns to the humble stories of animals and morals. And yet here lies wisdom.

The soul does not measure things as the world does. Small obediences matter. A dream, a gesture, a half-finished duty — all can be honored as part of the great harmony. When we listen deeply, we discover that nothing is wasted. Even a fable, set to verse in a prison cell, becomes an offering to the eternal.

Socrates shows us that preparing for death is not only about great truths but about completeness. About finishing what has been whispered to us, however small. About living so fully awake that no note of the soul’s music is left unsung.
