### Questions

* If my soul were judged today, what qualities would it carry into eternity?
* Where do I still need cleansing, forgiveness, or release?
* How can I practice mercy — receiving it for myself, and offering it to others?

---

*What I become, I bring with me. May my becoming be shaped by truth, softened by mercy, and guided toward the eternal good.*
