### Reflection

There is a calmness here that feels larger than philosophy or religion. It is the calm of a soul already at home in what is eternal. Socrates does not hurry, nor does he resist. He tends to the moment: stretching sore limbs, honoring a dream, noticing how joy and pain walk together.

This is what it means to live awake. To see that life whispers through even small things. To prepare for death not with grand gestures but with quiet completeness.

We too are called to this spaciousness — to honor the whispers of the soul, to finish what is given to us, and to see pain and joy as threads of the same fabric. To live so that when endings come, they feel less like interruption and more like the natural closing of a song.
