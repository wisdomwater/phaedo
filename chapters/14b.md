### Reflection

Here the teaching grows sharp and clear: we do not escape ourselves in death. What we have practiced, we become. What we become, we carry. Judgment is not arbitrary but the unfolding of what is already within.

And yet this vision is not without hope. Even the guilty may find release through repentance, through forgiveness, through mercy. The rivers do not exist to crush but to cleanse. The soul that turns may still rise.

This calls us to live with awareness. Every choice, every attachment, every act of love or cruelty shapes the soul. We are preparing, even now, for the journey beyond. The question is not what we say we believe, but what we are becoming.
