### Questions

* What doubts or questions do I carry that I hesitate to voice?
* How can I hold these questions not with fear, but with gentleness and openness?
* Who in my life can walk with me in honest searching, without judgment or haste?

*Truth does not fear questions. May I learn to welcome them, to hold them gently, and to keep searching with an open soul.*
