### Questions

* How do I experience the difference between “life in the body” and the deeper sense of “life in the soul”?
* What practices help me touch that current of life that does not depend on health, youth, or circumstances?
* What would change if I trusted that the soul is woven of life itself, and cannot die?

*The soul is life-bearing, and life cannot perish. May I rest in this truth, and live from the current that flows through all things.*
