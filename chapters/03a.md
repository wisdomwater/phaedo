# Chapter 3: Why Suicide is Forbidden

As the conversation deepened, Cebes asked a hard question: if the soul longs to be freed from the body, why is it wrong to hasten that freedom through suicide?

Socrates replied gently. We are not our own. Just as a prisoner must not break the door of his cell without the keeper’s leave, so we must not depart this life without the will of the gods. Our lives are held in trust; we are not merely owners of our bodies, but stewards.

Cebes pressed further: if we belong to the gods, why should the philosopher not rejoice to remain under their care, rather than hasten away? Socrates smiled. “Because I am going to other gods,” he said, “gods who are wise and good. And perhaps I will find better friends there than even you.” He spoke with such confidence that the company, though sorrowful, felt his calmness seep into them.

Here was a paradox: the philosopher desires death, not out of despair, but out of longing. Yet he does not seize it by his own hand. Death must be received, not taken.
