# Chapter 10: Facing Objections with Gentleness

Socrates’ words carried weight, yet his friends still wrestled with doubts. Out of respect, they hesitated to speak. But Socrates encouraged them: *“Do not spare me. If I am mistaken, help me see it. Better to test the argument now than let it go unexamined.”*

Simmias spoke first. Perhaps the soul is not immortal at all, but only a kind of harmony. Just as the lyre produces music when its strings are tuned, perhaps the body produces the soul as a harmony of its parts. And when the lyre breaks, the harmony vanishes. Might the soul perish in the same way?

Then Cebes raised his concern. Even if the soul is stronger than the body, might it not wear out after many lifetimes, like a cloak that outlasts many weavers but eventually falls to pieces itself? Perhaps the soul outlives one body, or even many, but not all. In the end, it too may dissolve.

The room fell into thoughtful silence. These were no small objections. And yet Socrates did not scold or grow impatient. He welcomed the questions with calm. “Let us not become haters of argument,” he said, “just because some prove false. Let us search again, together.”
