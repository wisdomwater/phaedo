# Chapter 7: Recollection of Truth

Socrates continued: another way we can see the soul’s life beyond the body is through the power of recollection.

When we learn, he said, it is often less about discovering something new and more about remembering something we somehow already knew. Even the uneducated can recognize a truth when it is drawn out of them with the right questions, as though knowledge had been sleeping in their soul, waiting to awaken.

Think of how one face calls to mind another, or how the sight of a lyre recalls the one who plays it. Our minds make leaps beyond what is before our eyes. Or consider the idea of equality: two sticks or stones may appear equal, yet they always fall short of true equality. We recognize their imperfection only because we already carry within us the idea of equality itself — a standard higher than anything our senses can give.

Where did such knowledge come from? Not from this life, for the senses only remind us, they do not create the idea. It must have been given before birth, carried into this life from another. If we have known truth once, before we entered this body, then the soul must have existed before birth — and if before, why not also after?

This teaching resonates with something deep in us. There are moments when truth feels less like discovery and more like recognition. We say, *“Of course! I’ve always known this somehow.”* The soul stirs, remembering.

The mystics across traditions have spoken of this: wisdom is not foreign but native to the soul. The divine is not imposed from without but uncovered within. To remember is to awaken.

If our lives are a journey of recollection, then perhaps death itself is the great remembering — the soul shedding the fog of the senses and recalling fully what it has always been. Learning here is rehearsal for that greater awakening.

* What truths in my life have felt less like “new discoveries” and more like “remembering”?
* How do I experience the soul’s subtle stirrings — those moments of recognition that seem older than I am?
* What would it mean to live as though learning were awakening, each insight a glimpse of eternal truth?

*Wisdom is remembering. May I live awake, attentive to the truths my soul already carries.*
