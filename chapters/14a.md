# **Chapter 14: Judgment of the Soul**

Socrates described what happens when souls reach the judgment.

Those who are incurable — who have lived in cruelty or committed great injustice without remorse — are hurled into Tartarus, never to return.

Those whose faults are serious but not beyond healing undergo punishment. For a year they are swept along by rivers of fire or lament until they are carried to the lake of Acheron. There, they call out to those they wronged, begging release. If forgiveness is granted, they emerge cleansed and free. If not, they are drawn back into their punishments until mercy comes.

Those who lived decently but without deep purification dwell in the upper earth, receiving reward for their good deeds. But the pure — those who lived in detachment and sought wisdom above all — ascend to the true earth above, dwelling in radiant places, in the company of the gods themselves.

Socrates was clear: perhaps the details of the picture are uncertain. But this much is sure — the soul carries into death only what it has become, and justice follows.
