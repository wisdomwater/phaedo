# Chapter 2: Music of the Soul

Socrates’ friends, curious about his new habit of poetry, asked why a man who had never written verse would turn to it now, in the final days of his life.

He explained that for years, dreams had visited him with the same message: *“Socrates, practice music.”* He had always taken this to mean the pursuit of philosophy, for what is philosophy but the harmony of the soul with truth? Yet, as his end drew near, he began to wonder if the command also asked for something simpler, something more literal. And so, he took up the task of setting Aesop’s fables into verse.

This was not a retreat from philosophy, but a fulfillment of it. By honoring the whisper of the dream, he left nothing undone. He sought to enter death with no thread left hanging, no note left unplayed. Even the simplest fable, turned into song, became part of his offering.
