### Questions

* Where in my life do I see the rhythm of opposites — loss giving birth to renewal, endings making way for beginnings?
* What changes or “little deaths” have I feared, only to find they opened into new life?
* How might I live more at peace with the great turning, trusting the cycle that holds all things?

*Life and death are partners in a dance. May I learn to move with them, not in fear but in trust.*
