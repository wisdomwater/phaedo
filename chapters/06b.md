### Reflection

This first argument may feel simple, but its power is in its simplicity. Look anywhere in nature: seeds die to become plants, seasons fade to make way for new growth, sleep restores the body for waking. Opposites turn into one another, keeping the world alive.

Why should the soul be different? To imagine death as the end is to imagine the world suddenly breaking its pattern. But the soul, too, belongs to the rhythm. Life feeds into death, and death into life, like inhaling and exhaling, like tides rising and falling.

There is comfort here. Death does not stand outside the order of things, but within it. It is not an interruption but a continuation. The cycle holds, and we are carried within it.
