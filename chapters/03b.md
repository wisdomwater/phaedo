### Reflection

Socrates’ answer reaches into the heart of our human struggle. Life is a gift, but not ours to control. The body, the breath, the heartbeat — all are given, and all will one day be returned. To take life into our own hands is to confuse possession with stewardship.

At the same time, there is no clinging. Socrates does not hold fast to life for its own sake. He trusts that the soul journeys onward, guided into wiser hands, toward deeper companionship. His calmness arises from surrender in both directions — neither grasping nor rejecting, but receiving each moment as it comes.

This is the way of the soul that lives awake: to accept life as gift, and death as passage. To live fully, and yet to let go when the hour comes.
