### Questions

* Where in my life am I practicing “virtue” for the sake of fear, pride, or gain?
* What would it mean to practice goodness simply as freedom and clarity of soul?
* How might I begin to purify my life — not to earn, but to see more clearly?

*True virtue is not bargaining, but release. May I learn to let go of all that clouds the soul, until only light remains.*
