### Reflection

This is one of the most hopeful turns in the dialogue. Socrates reminds us that we mistake the body for the self. Yet the body is only the outer garment, changing daily, destined to fade. The soul is of another kind — invisible, commanding, capable of touching what is eternal.

When we glimpse beauty, when we feel conscience stir, when we taste joy that no possession can give — these are moments when the soul remembers her kinship with the divine. They remind us that we are not creatures of clay alone, but also of light.

To live with this awareness is to loosen fear of death. For if the soul is of the same nature as what is immortal, then death is not the soul’s end but her return.
