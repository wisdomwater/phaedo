# Chapter 9: The Soul in Chains

Socrates then turned to a sobering vision: not every soul departs in purity.

The soul that has been bound to bodily cravings — clinging to pleasures, weighed down by anger, greed, or violence — does not rise easily when death comes. She lingers near the body she once loved, unwilling to leave, appearing as a restless shadow. Saturated with the senses, she drifts like a ghost, longing for what she cannot hold.

At last such a soul is drawn into another body, according to her nature. Some are carried into the forms of animals that match their former lives — donkeys for the dull and indulgent, wolves for the violent, birds of prey for the greedy. Others, who lived with decency but without philosophy, may be reborn as gentler creatures, bees or ants, social and orderly.

But only the soul that has lived in true purification — loosening the grip of desires, practicing detachment, seeking wisdom above pleasure — is released fully into the company of the divine. Such a soul does not return to the prison-house of flesh, but journeys to the higher realms.
