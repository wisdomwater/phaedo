### Questions

* How do I think of death: as an ending, a healing, or something else?
* What “debts” or unfinished tasks remain in my life, and how might I complete them?
* How can I live so that when my own end comes, it is marked not by fear, but by peace?

*Death is not the enemy but the final healing. May I live attentively, so that when the last cup comes, I may drink with peace and leave nothing undone.*
