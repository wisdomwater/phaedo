### Questions

* What are the “noisy” demands in my life that keep me from hearing the quiet voice of the soul?
* How might I practice letting go — loosening the grip of possessions, cravings, or fears — so I can live more freely?
* What glimpses of truth have I already seen when I step back from distraction and listen deeply?

*To practice death is to practice freedom. May I learn to let go of what binds me, and to live already in the light of eternity.*
