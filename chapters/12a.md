# Chapter 12: How We Ought to Live

With the arguments completed, Socrates paused. The room was quiet, his companions listening with full hearts. Then he asked the question that matters most: *If the soul is immortal, what kind of life should we live?*

For death is not an escape. The wicked do not leave their corruption behind; they carry it with them. The soul takes into death only what it has become in life. Whatever we have practiced — greed or purity, love or hatred, truth or falsehood — these become our companions beyond the grave.

Socrates described the journey: when death comes, the soul is led to judgment. Those beyond cure are cast into Tartarus, never to return. Others, whose sins are great but not without remedy, endure a year of purging before being carried to the lake of Acheron, where they beg forgiveness from those they have wronged. If pardoned, they are released; if not, they are drawn back into their punishments until mercy is granted.

But those who lived in purity, detached from cravings, devoted to wisdom, are freed to dwell in the higher realms. They ascend lightly, their souls unburdened, their company divine.
