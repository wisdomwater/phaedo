### Questions

* What small, unfinished duties tug gently at me?
* How do I respond to endings in my own life — with resistance, or with peace?
* Where can I notice the quiet harmony between joy and sorrow today?

*Every ending carries its own music. May I learn to listen, to join in the song, and to leave this world in peace.*
