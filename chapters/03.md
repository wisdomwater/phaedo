# Chapter 3: Why Suicide is Forbidden

As the conversation deepened, Cebes asked a hard question: if the soul longs to be freed from the body, why is it wrong to hasten that freedom through suicide?

Socrates replied gently. We are not our own. Just as a prisoner must not break the door of his cell without the keeper’s leave, so we must not depart this life without the will of the gods. Our lives are held in trust; we are not merely owners of our bodies, but stewards.

Cebes pressed further: if we belong to the gods, why should the philosopher not rejoice to remain under their care, rather than hasten away? Socrates smiled. “Because I am going to other gods,” he said, “gods who are wise and good. And perhaps I will find better friends there than even you.” He spoke with such confidence that the company, though sorrowful, felt his calmness seep into them.

Here was a paradox: the philosopher desires death, not out of despair, but out of longing. Yet he does not seize it by his own hand. Death must be received, not taken.

### Reflection

Socrates’ answer reaches into the heart of our human struggle. Life is a gift, but not ours to control. The body, the breath, the heartbeat — all are given, and all will one day be returned. To take life into our own hands is to confuse possession with stewardship.

At the same time, there is no clinging. Socrates does not hold fast to life for its own sake. He trusts that the soul journeys onward, guided into wiser hands, toward deeper companionship. His calmness arises from surrender in both directions — neither grasping nor rejecting, but receiving each moment as it comes.

This is the way of the soul that lives awake: to accept life as gift, and death as passage. To live fully, and yet to let go when the hour comes.

* Do I live as though my life is something I own, or something I steward?
* Where am I clinging too tightly — to possessions, relationships, or even to life itself?
* How might I practice trust, releasing my grip and receiving each moment as it comes?

---

*Life is a gift, not a possession. May I learn to live with open hands — receiving with gratitude, releasing with trust.*
