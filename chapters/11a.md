# Chapter 11: The Form of Life

Having listened carefully to Simmias and Cebes, Socrates began to answer.

To Simmias, he said: if the soul were only a harmony, it could not exist before the body. And yet they had already agreed that the soul remembers truths from before birth. A harmony is an effect, but the soul is a cause. It leads rather than follows. More than this, a harmony cannot resist its instrument, yet the soul often resists the pull of the body — standing firm against pain or desire. The soul, then, cannot be merely a tune played by the body’s strings.

Turning to Cebes’ fear, Socrates acknowledged the seriousness of the question. Could the soul wear out after many bodies, like a cloak outlasting several weavers before fraying at last? To answer, he turned to a deeper principle: the nature of opposites.

Some things, he said, are inseparable from the qualities they carry. Cold cannot welcome heat, nor fire cold. The number three cannot be even, for it always carries oddness. In the same way, the soul always carries life. It is bound to life as fire is bound to heat. And just as fire cannot admit cold without ceasing to be fire, so the soul cannot admit death without ceasing to be soul.

But the soul is life itself. And what bears life cannot die.
