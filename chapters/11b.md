### Reflection

Here we arrive at the heart of Socrates’ reasoning: the soul is not merely something that *has* life. It is something woven of life. It bears life the way fire bears heat. To imagine its end is to imagine life itself ending — which cannot be.

We may not follow every step of Plato’s logic, but the image speaks beyond logic. The soul belongs to life. Not the flickering of breath, but the current that flows through all things. And so the soul does not scatter with the body’s dust. It returns to the stream of life, where it has always belonged.

This brings us to a turning in the dialogue: doubt has been faced, arguments tested, and hope affirmed. The soul is immortal, not by accident, but by nature.
