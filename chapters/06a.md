# Chapter 6: The Cycle of Opposites

The friends listened closely, but still a question remained: how can we know the soul survives after death?

Socrates began with a simple observation — that life itself is a rhythm of opposites. Everything comes to be from its opposite: what is greater once was smaller, what is weaker once was stronger, waking comes from sleep, and sleep from waking. The pattern holds for all things.

So too with life and death. The living come from the dead, just as the dead come from the living. If it were not so, the cycle would break, and all would eventually collapse into stillness. But the world continues, because life and death feed into one another, rising and falling like day and night.

Thus, when we die, we are not stepping into nothingness but into the other side of the cycle. Death is not an end but a passage, part of the great turning that sustains all things.
