# Chapter 13: The Earth and Its Rivers

To help his friends imagine the journey of the soul, Socrates offered a vision of the earth and the realms beyond.

What we call “the earth,” he said, is only one small hollow — a shadow of the true earth above, which rests balanced at the center of the heavens. If we could rise like birds through the air, just as fish rise to the surface of the sea, we would see the world as it truly is: not this corrupted land of mud and mist, but a radiant earth of many colors, jeweled and shining, filled with flowers and fruits beyond number.

In that higher world, the blessed dwell. Some live by the sea of pure air, others on the “islands of the blest.” They converse with the gods, they behold the sun, moon, and stars in their true brightness. Their joy is of one piece with the beauty around them.

But beneath, hidden within the earth, lie vast chasms and rivers, connecting all things. The greatest is Tartarus, the deep abyss, into which flow streams of fire, mud, and water. From these flow the mighty rivers: Oceanus, circling the earth; Acheron, flowing to the lake where most souls await their return; Pyriphlegethon, the river of fire; and Cocytus, the river of lament, which forms the dark waters of Styx.

Through these rivers the souls of the dead are carried — some to punishment, some to cleansing, some to peace.
