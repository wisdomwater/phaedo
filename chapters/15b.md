### Reflection

There is mystery in Socrates’ final words: *“We owe a cock to Asclepius.”* Asclepius was the god of healing, and a cock was offered in thanks for recovery. Was Socrates saying that death itself was a kind of healing, the soul finally cured of the body’s afflictions? Or was he simply honoring a forgotten duty, showing that nothing should be left undone?

Either way, his final act was consistent with his life: attentive, faithful, at peace. He met death as he had lived — with serenity, clarity, and completeness.

For us, the lesson is not to imitate every detail, but to see what shines through: that death need not be feared. That life, if lived attentively, prepares us for dying. That every act, even the smallest offering, matters. And that wisdom is not only in words but in the way one departs.
