# Chapter 12: How We Ought to Live

With the arguments completed, Socrates paused. The room was quiet, his companions listening with full hearts. Then he asked the question that matters most: *If the soul is immortal, what kind of life should we live?*

For death is not an escape. The wicked do not leave their corruption behind; they carry it with them. The soul takes into death only what it has become in life. Whatever we have practiced — greed or purity, love or hatred, truth or falsehood — these become our companions beyond the grave.

Socrates described the journey: when death comes, the soul is led to judgment. Those beyond cure are cast into Tartarus, never to return. Others, whose sins are great but not without remedy, endure a year of purging before being carried to the lake of Acheron, where they beg forgiveness from those they have wronged. If pardoned, they are released; if not, they are drawn back into their punishments until mercy is granted.

But those who lived in purity, detached from cravings, devoted to wisdom, are freed to dwell in the higher realms. They ascend lightly, their souls unburdened, their company divine.

Here Socrates moves from theory to practice: if the soul is immortal, then every choice matters. We do not cast off our character at death like a worn garment. We carry into eternity the self we have become.

This is both sobering and hopeful. Sobering, because we cannot hide from what we are — the soul remembers. Hopeful, because purification is always possible. Each act of letting go, each step toward wisdom, each practice of truth makes the soul lighter, more ready for the journey.

Life, then, is rehearsal for eternity. Not in fear, but in freedom. We are shaping, even now, the soul we will carry beyond this life.

* If my soul were to carry only what I have become today into eternity, what would I bring?
* What habits, desires, or attachments might weigh me down?
* How can I begin even now to lighten my soul — through truth, love, or letting go?

---

*The soul carries only what it has become. May I live with wisdom, shaping a soul light enough to rise, free enough to enter the company of the eternal.*
