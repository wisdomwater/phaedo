### Questions

* What recurring “whispers” or nudges have I ignored in my life?
* Is there a small duty or creative act I’ve postponed, waiting for a better time?
* What would it look like to honor those whispers today, as part of my soul’s song?

*The soul is always making music. May I learn to listen, to add my note, and to leave no melody unfinished.*
