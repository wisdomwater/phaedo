### Reflection

This teaching resonates with something deep in us. There are moments when truth feels less like discovery and more like recognition. We say, *“Of course! I’ve always known this somehow.”* The soul stirs, remembering.

The mystics across traditions have spoken of this: wisdom is not foreign but native to the soul. The divine is not imposed from without but uncovered within. To remember is to awaken.

If our lives are a journey of recollection, then perhaps death itself is the great remembering — the soul shedding the fog of the senses and recalling fully what it has always been. Learning here is rehearsal for that greater awakening.
