### Reflection

Socrates’ words strike at the heart of what we call goodness. How often do we choose what looks noble, only to find that underneath is fear, pride, or calculation? We restrain ourselves not out of purity but out of strategy. We call it courage, but it is fear of greater loss. We call it temperance, but it is desire for better reward.

True virtue is of another kind. It is not an exchange but a release. It is not measured by what we fear or gain, but by how free the soul has become. Purification is not about earning anything, but about clearing space — space for wisdom, space for light, space for the eternal to shine through.

This is what the mystics of all traditions have seen: virtue is not performance but alignment, not calculation but transformation.
